# LCQP - A solver for Linear Complementarity Quadratic Programs written in MATLAB
The solver was presented [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05965). A C++ implementation will follow.

## Requirements
The only requirement (besided matlab) is to have the qpOASES matlab interface installed. Please follow [these installation instructions](https://www.coin-or.org/qpOASES/doc/3.0/manual.pdf).
